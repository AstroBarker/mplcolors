# mplcolors
Tired of searching "[matplotlib colors](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=matplotlib+colors&atb=v275-4&ia=web)" every week/day/hour?
This simple script displays them all conveniently right in your terminal emulator!

# Useage
It's probably easiest to create an alias in your shell's rc file (e.g., `.bashrc`) such as 
```shell
alias mplcolors='python /path/to/dir/mplcolors.py'
```
